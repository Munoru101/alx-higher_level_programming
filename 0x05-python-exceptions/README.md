Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during exceution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal. Most exceptions are not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages. Exceptions come in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message. The string printed as the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that occurred. This is true for all built-in exceptions but need not be true for user-defined exceptions, albeit a usefule convention. The preceding part of the error message shows the context where the exception occurrede, in the form of a stack traceback. In general, it contains a stack tarceback listing source lines; however, it will not display lines read from standard input
